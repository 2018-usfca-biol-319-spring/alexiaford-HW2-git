After looking at the scatterplot for the site at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Wisconsin one finds there are very few notable differences seen between the two plots. The only real difference I discovered was University of Wisconsin on the scatterplot provides data for dry mass of leaves (grams) for November while not displaying much data for the dry mass of leaves in the months before June. On the other hand, the University of Notre Dame was just the opposite in that the plot provides data for the months before June while not showing much data past October. This difference however is not as telling as how similar the peaks in the both plots were. Both University's display peaks and major increased dry mass of leaves from the months of mid September to the end of October with similar ranges for each of these months and peaks.

To conclude, I would like to take a closer look at why the similarities between the two sites dry mass leave ranges may have occurred. A major similarity I found for both sites while browsing NEON's data was the sites similarities in latitude and their similarities in ecosystems (both are terrestrial). After reading Chapter 20 in Ecology by William D Bowman I found Figure 20.18 helpful in answering why these sites may have similar scatterplots, and discovered that terrestrial ecosystems with similar latitudes also have similar net primary production (NPP). As NPP= GPP-respiration and GPP is controlled by rates of photosynthesis and leaf area index, it makes sense the dry mass of leaves in both sites were very similar as they are similar ecosystems with similar latitudes resulting in similar NPP's which then is also influenced by the leaf area index.
